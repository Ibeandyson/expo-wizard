# Standard Way of Committing üöÄ
Contributing to this projevct requires proper workflow to ensure smooth collaboration. Follow these best practices:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork the Repository
Go to the project‚Äôs GitHub repo.
Click the Fork button (top right) to create a personal copy.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Your Fork Locally
Open your terminal and run:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERN/expo-wizard.git
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with the actual repo name.

Move into the project folder:

sh
Copy code
cd REPO_NAME
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Upstream Remote
To keep your fork updated with the original repo:

sh
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RRNEPHC/expo-wizard/.git
Verify remotes:

sh
Copy code
git remote -v
You should see origin (your fork) and upstream (the original repo).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch for Your Changes
Avoid working on the main branch. Instead, create a feature branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/fix-bug
Use a descriptive branch name like fix-login-issue or add-dark-mode.

Edit files using your preferred code editor (VS Code, etc.).

git status.

sh

9Ô∏è‚É£ Keep Your Fork Updated (Sync with Upstream)
If the original repo updates, sync changes: sh Copy code git checkout main git fetch upstream git merge upstream/main git push origin main Then, update your feature branch:
sh Copy code git checkout feature/fix-bug git merge main git push origin feature/fix-bug

üîü Wait for Review & Make Changes if Needed Maintain polite and professional discussions with maintainers.
If requested, update your PR and push changes:
sh
Copy code
git add .
git commit --amend -m "Fix: Improve login validation"
git push --force
Once approved, the PR will be merged! üéâ
